## Why LoongCollector?

LoongCollector is a high-performance, lightweight observability data collector designed for modern cloud-native environments. Born from Alibaba's 15-year journey handling exponential traffic growth and powering tens of millions of deployments, LoongCollector delivers **10x higher throughput** with **80% lower resource usage** compared to open-source alternatives.

### üöÄ Core Advantages

- **‚ö° High Performance**
  - 10x higher throughput with 80% less resource usage compared to competitors
  - Linear scaling with predictable performance growth

- **üõ°Ô∏è Production-Ready**
  - Battle-tested in Alibaba's production environment for 15+ years
  - Powers tens of millions of deployments, collecting hundreds of petabytes daily

- **üîß All-in-One Collection**
  - Unified agent for logs, metrics, traces, events, and profiles
  - Native Kubernetes support
  - eBPF-powered network monitoring and security event collection

- **üéØ Pluggable Architecture**
  - 100+ built-in plugins with multi-language development (C++, Go)
  - Powerful SPL engine for flexible data processing

- **‚öôÔ∏è Advanced Management**
  - Remote configuration management via SLS console, SDK, K8s Operator
  - Self-monitoring, flow control, resource control, alarms, and statistics collection.

### üìä Performance Benchmarks

**Maximum Throughput Comparison**

| Log Type | LoongCollector | FluentBit | Vector | Filebeat |
|----------|----------------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Single Line | **546 MB/s** | 36 MB/s | 38 MB/s | 9 MB/s |
| Multi-line | **238 MB/s** | 24 MB/s | 22 MB/s | 6 MB/s |
| Regex Parsing | **68 MB/s** | 19 MB/s | 12 MB/s | Not Supported |

*üìà **Breaking Point Analysis**: While competitors hit CPU saturation at ~40 MB/s, LoongCollector maintains linear scaling up to **546 MB/s** on a single processing thread.*


**Resource Efficiency at 10 MB/s Processing Load**

| Scenario | LoongCollector | FluentBit | Vector | Filebeat |
|----------|----------------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Simple Line (512B) | 3.40% CPU<br>29.01 MB RAM | 12.29% CPU (+261%)<br>46.84 MB RAM (+61%) | 35.80% CPU (+952%)<br>83.24 MB RAM (+186%) | **Performance Insufficient** |
| Multi-line (512B) | 5.82% CPU<br>29.39 MB RAM | 28.35% CPU (+387%)<br>46.39 MB RAM (+57%) | 55.99% CPU (+862%)<br>85.17 MB RAM (+189%) | **Performance Insufficient** |
| Regex (512B) | 14.20% CPU<br>34.02 MB RAM | 37.32% CPU (+162%)<br>46.44 MB RAM (+36%) | 43.90% CPU (+209%)<br>90.51 MB RAM (+166%) | **Not Supported** |

## üèóÔ∏è Performance And Reliability Architecture Highlights

**1. Memory Arena: Zero-Copy Design**
- Shared memory pool (SourceBuffer) stores all string data once per event group
- String_view references point to original data segments instead of copying

**2. Lock-Free Event Pool**
- Thread-aware allocation strategies eliminate lock contention
- Same-thread pools for direct reuse, double-buffer pools for cross-thread scenarios

**3. Zero-Copy Serialization: Direct Network Output**
- Bypasses intermediate Protobuf objects, serializes directly to network format

**4. Multi-Tenant Pipeline Isolation**
- High-low watermark feedback queues prevent pipeline interference
- Independent resource allocation per pipeline with automatic back-pressure control
- Ensures one pipeline failure doesn't affect others

**5. Fair Resource Allocation**
- Priority-aware round-robin scheduling ensures fairness while respecting business priorities
- Higher priority pipelines always processed first, fair distribution within same priority level
- Automatic resource yielding when constraints occur

**6. Self-Healing Network Resilience**
- Adaptive concurrency limiting per destination using AIMD (Additive Increase, Multiplicative Decrease)
- Fast failure detection and gradual recovery to prevent network jitter
- Zero data loss guarantee with intelligent back-pressure control

## üè≠ Production Validation: Battle-Tested at Scale

LoongCollector has been battle-tested in some of the world's most demanding production environments:

- **Alibaba Group**: Powers the entire Alibaba ecosystem including Double 11 shopping festival
- **Alibaba Cloud**: Serves tens of thousands of enterprise customers
- **Ant Group**: Handles financial transaction observability at massive scale
- **Daily Data Volume**: Hundreds of petabytes of observability data
- **Deployment Scale**: Tens of millions of active deployments

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Docker (for building from source)
- Go 1.19+ (for building from source)

### Build and Run

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/alibaba/loongcollector.git
cd loongcollector
